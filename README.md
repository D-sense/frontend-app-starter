Frontend-starter app bootstraps your frontend web developement: it is a simple yet rich and powerful modern frontend app starter. It is packed with Webpack, Twitter Bootstrap and well-defined CSS media queries.

The stacks below have been installed for you. Get started building your app right away!
- `Webpack`: Installed with basic plugins for processing css, scss, and image compression. You can add more to suit your project requirement.
- `Bootstrap v4.0 (BETA)`: Keep in mind, almost all the media queries your app may need have been defined in scss.basic.scss. - The scss._custom.scss is used to override the Bootstrap scss styles; feel free to override the styles further.
- `Sass`.
- `jQuery`.

# Basic Installation
- Install node.js ">= 8.1.3"
- Install npm  ">= 5.0.3"

# Basic Usage
Simply fork this repo or use the manual download method:
- Navigate to the folder where the repo is downloaded in and run `npm install`. Run `npm run build` for most changes (preferrably all) you make during your app development. Of course, you are free to submit PR for `watchmode` loader to automate the sass processing. Enjoy :)
